				There are two teams. Each team has one leader, who knows what
				cards are assigned to which team. The starting team has to guess 9
				cards, the second team has 8. Each game also has 8 neutral
				cards and one assassin.<br>
				<br>
				The leaders take turns giving one word clues about what cards their
				team should pick. Their clue also comes with the number of cards
				they think should relate to the clue, and the team gets that many
				chances to flip a card and reveal its team. The first team to reveal all
				of their cards, wins.<br>
				<br>
				If using skype or discord to chat, the leaders shouldn't speak or give
				any hints besides the clue and the number.<br>
				<br>
				It's important what kind of clues are given.<br>
				1) It has to be either one word or a proper noun. ("household" or "The
				Sound Of Music")<br>
				2) The clue cannot match or contain one of the words on the board.<br>
				3) The clue cannot relate to the cards <b>solely</b> through spelling, rhyme,
				or number of letters. (You can't give the clue "three" to tell the players
				to choose all three letter words. "Fart" can't be used to hint at the
				word PART. But "please" can be a clue for CHEESE, since it's
				common to say please when asking someone to pass you food.)<br>
				5) The number of guesses cannot also be a clue. ("Drink, 3" cannot
				relate to WINE and TRIANGLE)<br>
				<br>
				Extra Stuff:<br>
				If a card is flipped that doesn't belong to your team, your turn is over.<br>
				If the assassin card is flipped you instantly lose the game. Leaders:
				make sure your clue doesn't relate to the black card!<br>
				Giving someone "zero" guesses means your team gets as many
				guesses as they like and they're looking for everything that <b>doesn't</b>
				match the clue.<br>
				Giving someone "infinite" guesses means they can keep guessing
				until they win or until they guess a word that isn't for their team.</p>
